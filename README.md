# VEX BOS frontend 
VEX is an Esports betting platform that leverages NEARâ€™s technology to provide an immersive and interactive betting experience; you can see how we do that [here](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=771419D39CC38DC6!304&authkey=!AEPErdIZLqzIV3Y&ithint=file%2cdocx&e=g4iBlJ)

For this hackathon, we decided to build out a decentralised BOS frontend. The frontend is composed of a gateway and three pages. The betting page lists all the future matches in the backend; you can select one of these matches and then choose how much you want to bet in NEAR and on which team. Since parimutuel betting is implemented, the odds are a function of the user's bets. The potential winnings are calculated by integrating over the odds with respect to the bet amount. Once the match is finished, users will be paid out. 

You can enter the gateway here (please note it only works with Meteor Wallet): betvex.xyz 


Or you can enter via the standard BOS gateway: https://test.near.org/vex-hackathon.testnet/widget/VEXNavbar
